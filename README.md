Contribute
----------

1. Setup development environment:

    ```
    npm install -g gulp bower

    cd static
    npm install
    bower install
    ```

  (If you don't want to install system-wide, run e.g. `npm config set prefix ~/.local/npm_prefix` beforehand; then run the tools from `~/.local/npm_prefix/bin`.)

2. Run *watcher*:

    ```
    cd static && gulp
    ```

3. Visit http://localhost:3000/2015/

 This is needed because the development version doesn't have the 2015 redirect set up.

4. Commit changes and submit pull-request

Publish to AWS S3 (authorization required)
------------------------------------------

`master` branch is published automatically to [][cz.pycon.org] and `dev` branch
to [][dev.pycon.cz] in CircleCI. If you want to do it manually, you need to:

1. Copy `aws.json.example` to `aws.json` and provide credentials for your
   AWS IAM role.

2. Build all static assets and publish them to S3 (domain [][dev.pycon.cz]):

    ```
    gulp publish
    ```

Running `gulp publish --production` will publish static assets to
[][cz.pycon.org].
