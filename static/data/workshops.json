Python-cryptography is a new emerging library which strives to provide \"crypto for humans\" in Python. In this workshop, we will explore how to use it to secure our applications in a reliable manner. No substantial cryptography knowledge required.",

This workshop will give you overview of some basic libraries and their Python bindings (GDAL, Proj4), more abstract and easier to be used libraries (Rasterio, Fiona, Shapely), and show you, how to access GeoServer and Mapserver from Python script. OGC Standards and how to deal with them, will be demonstrated using OWSLib. Apparently, the topic is so wide, that at the end nobody is expected to master all or at least one of mentioned (or not mentioned) technologies. This workshop is meant as introduction to the world of GeoPython and brief overview.",

And they are showing lot of promise in other fields too.\n\nThis workshop will provide an introduction to deep learning for natural language processing. It would cover some of the common deep learning architectures, advantages and concerns, along with some hands-on.\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n1) What is deep learning?\n2) Motivation: Some use cases where it has produced state-of-art results for NLP\n3) Introduction to neural networks; backpropagation algorithm\n4) Supervised learning: Text classification using multi-layer perceptron, recurrent neural networks\n5) Text generation using recurrent neural networks\n6) Impact of GPUs\n\nThe repository for this workshop:\nhttps://github.com/rouseguy/intro2deeplearning/\n\nPlease install the requirements prior to the workshop.\n\nRequirements\nThe attendee should understand the following terms:\n1. Bias and Variance\n2. Train, Test and Validation sets\n3. Cross-validation, grid-search, hyperparameter optimization\n4. Measuring model accuracy (Precision, Recall, F1 score, Area Under Curve)\n5. Supervised and Unsupervised learning\n\nKnowing Python is a plus, but not mandatory.",
